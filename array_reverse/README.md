# Array Reverse Code Challenge

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the provided array argument with elements in reversed order.

## Running the tests

Due to time constraints and some issues with understanding jest, tests have not yet been implemented. I felt it was more important to have this turned in before the deadline and will be happy to revisit the testing portion of this assignment.
